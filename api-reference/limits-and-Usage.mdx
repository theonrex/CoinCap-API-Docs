CoinCap enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage of the API and to prevent server overload.

### Rate Limits:
**Without an API Key:** 200 requests per minute

**With an API Key:** 500 requests per minute

### Historical Data:
Up to 11 years of historical data is available, regardless of whether you're using an API key or not.

### Handling Rate Limits:
When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests status code.

### How to Handle Rate Limit Errors:
Make sure your application is designed to handle 429 errors gracefully.
Implement backoff strategies such as retrying the request after a delay to prevent overloading the server.
